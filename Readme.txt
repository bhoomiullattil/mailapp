The application is partially funnctional  and is under development.
Prerequisites:

2.The pip package management tool
3.A Google account with Gmail enabled	
/*Note:There are some settings to be done inorder to ensure proper functioning of the mail.
1:Login to the google account through which you want to send the mail.
2:Open the account's security settings and allow access to less secure apps.This makes your account accessable by server.
(If you are just testing, then you can temporarily do this setting. For a permanent setup, I would recommend a new account. Since, using your main account will be risky.)
